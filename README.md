# Lane-Detection-using-CNN
In an era of increasing vehicle ownership and autonomous driving advancements, road safety is paramount. Lane detection plays a vital role in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles. This project employs deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to address the challenge of lane detection. By utilizing a diverse dataset, advanced techniques like data augmentation, and a well-structured CNN model, we develop a robust lane detection system. The project attains high accuracy, as measured by metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Notably, the system's practical applicability is demonstrated by overlaying detected lanes on video frames. In conclusion, this project successfully creates an accurate lane detection system, with potential applications in autonomous driving and significant contributions to road safety and the field of computer vision and deep learning.
